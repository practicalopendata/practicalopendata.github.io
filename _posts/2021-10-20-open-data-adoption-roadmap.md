# A simple roadmap for adopting open data

![jump](/img/kristopher-roller-rgrZVTjuuPw-unsplash.jpg)

Data is increasingly crucial to participate to the digital economy. However realizing the benefits of open data can be sometimes challenging as open data can cover many different realities, even though the term itself has been around for a long time. In that context, entities big and small, corporates or SMBs, NGOs or governments, should adopt a simple roadmap to build their open data muscle, start reaping its benefits while mitigating the associated legal and privacy risks.

## 1. Use more open data

Start your journey with using more open data assembled and released by third parties. Create a workflow for onboarding these assets within your organization, and for managing them once they’re onboarded. Integrate these public sources in your data governance system if you have one place.
As you use public datasets more and more, you will find that not two datasets are alike, and each needs to be assessed individually. In a nutshell, these are some of the key aspects of a dataset you need to consider to mitigate legal and privacy risks.
* who is the data provider – a well known entity publishing a dataset should care about its reputation and is more likely to take some precautions before releasing a dataset. 
* what is the legal framework for accessing and using the dataset – here certain details can matter, such as whether the dataset can be downloaded directly, or whether you need to click through terms to access it. Remember to check with your own counsel. In addition, terms for using a dataset sometimes rely on the premise that the data are encumbered by copyrights and that the data provider can enforce them, an assumption which is not necessarily always true with data. This can be an important nuance if the dataset has no apparent terms, a situation fairly frequent in practice.
* what is the nature of the data – datasets with privacy implications can carry much more risks than datasets with no personal data. That issue often needs to be considered in addition to the T&Cs, as some data providers, especially less sophisticated ones, can easily overlook that issue.
* how are you going to use the data – validating the performance of your existing model on public data has a vastly different risk profile than redistributing the dataset. 

## 2. Release open data

Once you get comfortable using open data and have a good understanding of the potential pitfalls, use that knowledge and experience to start releasing your own datasets under an open framework. Similar considerations apply as with the inbound use, although with more risk averse requirements and mitigation measures. Try to pick a permissive data agreement, such as the [CDLA-Permissive-2](https://cdla.dev/permissive-2-0/) or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), for sharing the data when you have the right to do so as it will make it easier for others to reuse your data. They may also help mitigate your exposure from claims from downstream users. Start small and work your way up. Understand how others are using your dataset. Think about maintaining and keeping your dataset up-to-date, and how to receive feedback from your community.
One advantage of releasing open data is that you have control on what’s in it. Tools and techniques such as anonymization can help mitigate risks in areas where legal terms may not be enough.

## 3. Collaborate with others on open data

That’s the most difficult step but one where the benefits of open data really come together. Imagine entities contributing important information about their organization to an open data commons, respecting the common data format, data accuracy, scope of disclosure, etc. This is increasingly key in certain areas such as sustainability and others. For example the [OS-Climate](https://www.os-climate.org/solution/) is such an organization trying to bring different entities to open up critical environmental indicators in a consistent way.
This author wonders whether it’s possible for an organization to jump ahead and engage in open data collaboration without first a good understanding of the two previous steps. While some quick wins may be possible, bad experiences may have dramatic consequences and set us back. As always, better to start small and early, and have a plan.
