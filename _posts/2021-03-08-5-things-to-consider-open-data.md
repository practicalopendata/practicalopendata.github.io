# 5 things to consider when dealing with open data

Open data holds the promise of [closing the “data divide”](https://news.microsoft.com/opendata/) and empowering everyone to innovate using data in a more transparent and responsible way. Even as important strides are made to share data more broadly and openly, questions remain that may slow the use of such data. To help realize the benefits of open data, I explore 5 considerations when using open data.

## 1. Open source software can provide a roadmap for open data
Open source software and open data can together form the basis of an open model of innovation that can help tackle key challenges of the 21st century. However open source software is much more established than open data, benefitting from several decades of industry experience. It is also protected by copyright by default with (somewhat) consistent regulations in every jurisdiction that is party to the Berne Convention. This is not the case for data. While open data does not benefit from the same industry consensus and consistent regulation across jurisdictions, the lessons learned from open source software can still help navigate some key issues related to open data. Such lessons may include the benefits of working with an open model of innovation, how to generate energy behind a project and encourage adoption, and how to engage with the community. One can think of open source software as a source of inspiration for open data, rather than a set of methods to replicate and apply as such.

## 2. Understand the differences between open data and open source software
As you approach open data, it is tempting to rely on mechanisms developed for working with open source software. However, it is important to keep in mind that open data is not the same thing as open source software, and many of the relevant practices may be very different. For example, contrary to open source software, many datasets will have no copyright protection and may actually be in the public domain. In addition, the way people use data is very different from how people use software. Open source software enables changing the source code to suit your needs. However, in production level deployment, it is rare that source code will be changed save to remedy problems, improve functionality, or add new capabilities. On the other hand, open data is likely to be post-processed, rearranged, have new features be created, in other words transformed in so many ways that it may not resemble the data upstream at all. That has important implications for the systems and processes set up to deal with open data, either internally, or as part of an open community.

## 3. Have a risk-based approach to open data
Open data does not necessarily mean a frictionless experience when using data. You may still have some conditions to implement when using open data, depending on how the data was shared. For instance, you may need to provide attribution and credit the source if you redistribute a dataset which has an attribution requirement. In addition, certain datasets may have additional issues which are not apparent simply by reading the terms and conditions of the agreement for the dataset, due to the nature of the data being shared. For example, there are many issues that need to be taken into account with regard to the use of personal data, such as privacy law and regulation. Additionally, the risk associated with a dataset will also depend on the use that you make of it. Testing an ML model on the dataset to estimate its performance without changing the model will not necessarily carry the same risk as redistributing the dataset to the public. There’s no pre-made formula taking into account the dataset, your intended use of the dataset, and your risk tolerance level that will give you a reliable answer. Develop a risk framework over time as you get more familiar with open data.

## 4. Keep in mind the 4 W’s (and 1 H)
Different factors may become relevant as you evaluate a dataset: Who is the dataset provider, when was it published and where, what’s in it, and how is it shared (i.e., under which terms). A dataset of pictures published at a time when privacy considerations were not paramount (such as the recently withdrawn [TinyImages](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/TinyImages/)) may not carry the same risk as one assembled more recently with that issue in mind. On the other hand, datasets which have been available for some time (the [Iris dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) has been around since 1936) with no history of issues may be lower risk that a brand new one. Similarly it may be easier and lower risk to comply with a well-known set of terms and conditions than a dataset with custom terms.

## 5. Get comfortable with sharing open data
Open data is not only about using data provided by others. One point of open data is to foster collaboration and join forces to solve difficult problems. To that end, think about sharing some of your data. A good place to start is organizational or corporate data with no privacy implications. For example the [OS-Climate](https://www.os-climate.org/) initiative is seeking to receive and aggregate environmental indicators from corporations to help the investor community make better informed investment decisions taking into account the impact of climate change. In any case, whether you release data as a standalone dataset or contribute to a community dataset, sharing data with others under an open model will bring benefits not unlike those of participating in an open source software project.
